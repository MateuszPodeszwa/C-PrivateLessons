# Challenge The 4 Sisters and the Duckbear

Four sisters own a chocolate farm and collect chocolate eggs laid by chocolate chickens every day. But more often than not, the number of eggs is not evenly divisible among the sisters, and everybody knows you cannot split a chocolate egg into pieces without ruining it. The arguments have grown more heated over time. The town is tired of hearing the four sisters complain, and Chandra, the town's Arbiter, has finally come up with a plan everybody can agree to. All four sisters get an equal number of chocolate eggs every day, and the remainder is fed to their pet duckbear. All that is left is to have some skilled Programmer build a program to tell them how much each sister and the duckbear should get.

## Objectives
1. Create a program that lets the user enter the number of chocolate eggs gathered that day.
2. Using / and %, compute how many eggs each sister should get and how many are left over for the duckbear.
3.  **Answer this question: ** What are three total egg counts where the duckbear gets more than each sister does? You can use the program you created to help you find the answer.
