# Purpose of this repository

This repository acts as a personal archive, capturing the evolving knowledge gained during my C# exploration. Although currently private, you're welcome to explore the code. Valuable feedback is encouraged and appreciated! I an currently learning C# and this repository is created to help me manage and store my assignents, tasks and lessons. I would be happy if this repo could help you as well. 

## Requirements

To execute this repository, you won't require any additional software or frameworks, except for the C# code where I assume you already have **dotnet** installed. In case you don't, you can easily follow the [Microsoft Tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net80). Furthermore, to view the lessons, you won't need any extra software apart from a basic Markdown reader or an integrated development environment (IDE). All the lessons and notes I've written are in Markdown format. While not mandatory, I highly recommend downloading Obsidian Software from [here](https://obsidian.md/). **Obsidian MD** is free note-taking software that supports Markdown and offers various other features. Although it's not necessary, as notes can be read by any IDE with Markdown support, Obsidian provides additional enhancements that significantly improve the overall experience.

## Installation

I assume that you know how to run C# code, and have knowledge about DOTNET commands. To access the notes and lessons, you simply open the folder inside the IDE of choosing. Assuming that you are using Obsidian MD, just press "Locate new vault" - or something sounding similar to it. I also included some od the .obsidian folder files, such as plugins. These plugins are necessary to use these notes as without them some of the code would make no sense. You don't have to worry about it, just use the **.obsidian** folder included in this repo. 

### Obsidian Plugins

To enable plugins you need to locate the settings, and enable the trust mode, safe mode - or something that sounds similar to it. Once plugins are enabled, you are welcomed to edit the notes.

## Contributions

If you identify issues or have suggestions for improvement, don't hesitate to create a pull request. Your input is not only welcomed but contributes to the learning process. Please provide explanations for any changes made.

## Learning Resources

12. **CSharp_008_RepairingTheClocktower**

The branches mentioned above are the most recent ones. I will not update this; I'm just providing a heads-up about what's inside and what the structure looks like. The main repository is named `Home-Root`, and it includes the lesson folder. All other branches have a similar structure. The first one after `CSharp_` represents a lesson, note, assignment, or simply a branch number like `012`, etc. The next is a branch or task title, such as `ThePrototype`. This is just a title. Sometimes you may encounter something like `_Project_`, which means that this repository contains a more significant project, not just a simple task. Usually, it encompasses every 10-15 tasks to test knowledge.

Tasks typically focus on a specific C# feature, such as arrays, converters, enums, etc. Projects encompass everything necessary to test and build a comprehensive application.
