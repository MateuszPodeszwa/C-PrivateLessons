# C# Learning Repository

Hello, Mateusz! Delighted to have you exploring my C# learning repository. This space is designed to document my coding journey in C# and the extensive world of .NET frameworks. Let's delve into some additional details about the repository and its branches:

## Purpose

This repository acts as a personal archive, capturing the evolving knowledge gained during my C# exploration. Although currently private, you're welcome to explore the code. Valuable feedback is encouraged and appreciated!

## Software

For editing C# project files, I recommend Visual Studio and JetBrains Rider for console apps. Additionally, consider using Obsidian MD for markdown notes. You can download it from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md), enhancing the viewing experience with features and addons that might not be supported by other IDEs.

## Contributions

If you identify issues or have suggestions for improvement, don't hesitate to create a pull request. Your input is not only welcomed but contributes to the learning process. Please provide explanations for any changes made.

## Portfolio

This repository is poised to evolve into a portfolio, showcasing my advancing proficiency in C#. I'm eager to share my progress and the skills cultivated through diverse projects.

## Learning Resources
