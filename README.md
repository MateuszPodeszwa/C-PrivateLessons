# Chellenge: Repairing the clocktower
This is a chellenge from a book about c# I am reading. I decideed to save my results in this repo to make it easier 
for other people to that read the same book.

## Description

The recent attacks damaged the great Clock-tower of Consolas. The citizens of Consolas have repaired most of it, 
except oe piece that requires the steady hand of a Programmer. It is the part that makes the clock tick and tock. 
Numbers flow the clock to make it go, and if the number is even, the clock's Pendulum should tick to the left; if 
the number is odd, the pendulum should tock to the right. Only a programmer canreate this critical clock element to 
make it work again.

## Objectives

- Take a number as inout from the console.
- Display the word "Tick" if the number is even.
- Display the word "Tock" if the number is odd.
