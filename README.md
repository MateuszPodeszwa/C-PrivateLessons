# Chellenge: Watchtower

There are watchtowers in the region around Consolas that can alert you when an enemy is spotted. With some help from 
you, they can tell you which direction the enemy is from the watchtower.

## Objectives

- ask the user for an `x` value and a `y` value. These are coordinates of the enemy relative to the watchtower's 
  location.
- Using the image on the right _(it make more sense if you have a book, page 78)_ `if` statements, and relational 
  operators, display a message about what direction the enemy is coming from. For example, "The enemy is to the 
  northwest!" or "The enemy is here!"
