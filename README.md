# C-PrivateLessons
This repo is used for testing and saving C# - the language I am learnign.

The main purpose of this repository is to store snippets and programs written with the use of C# and .NET frameworks. This is a private repository, but you are welcome to use it if you find the work stored here useful. This repository represents my journey, knowledge and all I know about C#. If you find any issues or problems in the code, please don’t hesitate to create a pull request with the correct code, and please don’t forget to explain it as it will help me with my study. I will use this repository as a future portfolio to showcase my knowledge and abilities in C#.

I am learning C# from different websites such as Codecademy, YouTube and Microsoft Learn platform. If you want to see my progress in this matter, I will include my social links to the mentioned platforms:
