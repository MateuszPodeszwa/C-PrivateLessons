# Discovering the `ReadKey` Method

The `ReadKey` method, is within the `Console` class. The method allows your program to wait for a key press from the user. 

Let's begin our exploration with a fundamental understanding. The `ReadKey` method is nested within the `Console` class it allows your program to patiently wait for a key press from the user. This feature allows for controlling the flow of the console application, making it responsive to specific user interactions. Also the method don't limit itself to just waiting, it actually collets the information about the key pressed. But I'll leave it for a later time.
## **Waiting for a Key Press**

The ``Console.ReadKey();`` method does not wait the user to push enter before completing. it waits for only a single keypress, so if you want to do something like "*Press any key to continue..*" this method will be good to use.

```c#
Console.WriteLine("Press any key to continue...");
Console.ReadKey();
```

The further code will not be executed until an any keypress occur, therefore it may be used as a simple "pause" method. But unfortunately as user press the key, for example a letter 'a' this key will stay on the screen. But there is a way around this! C# allows for creating multiple methods which share the same name, and have different inputs. So the ReadKey method.
## The `true` - a bool type argument

```c#
Console.ReadKey(true);
```

By passing the **true** argument into the method's bool input the method will output the [[Bool|bool]] value that won't be visible on the screen, as well as the selected key! Moreover, this method can be also used in `if` statements to check if the keystroke has occurred. 
# **Modifiers and Special Keys**

Now, let's dig a bit deeper into the cool stuff you can do with `ConsoleKeyInfo`. It's not just about the key you press; it's like a treasure chest full of information about modifiers and special keys. Let's check out a fun example to understand this better.
## The ConsoleKeyInfo Struct

Consider `ConsoleKeyInfo` struct[^2] as a comprehensive report on the key event. It goes beyond the mere character representation of the key and includes valuable metadata. This can be particularly useful when you're dealing with scenarios where modifier keys (like Ctrl, Shift, or Alt) or special keys (like function keys) play a role in the user interaction.

Here's an example illustrating its usage:

```csharp
ConsoleKeyInfo keyInfo = Console.ReadKey();
Console.WriteLine($"Key: {keyInfo.Key}, Character: {keyInfo.KeyChar}, Modifiers: {keyInfo.Modifiers}");
```

This snippet reveals intricate details about the pressed key, its character representation, and any associated modifiers or special keys, enhancing your understanding of user input. In this context, `keyInfo.Key` provides information about the main key pressed, `keyInfo.KeyChar` gives the character representation if applicable, and `keyInfo.Modifiers` reveals any modifiers involved in the key event. And then prints it to the console line.

### .Key Property

>[!info] .Key Property
>In the realm of `ConsoleKeyInfo`, the `Key` property represents the primary key that was pressed. This goes beyond just the character on the keyboard â€“ it encompasses a broader range of keys. Think of it as identifying the essence of the pressed key, whether it's a letter, a number, or even a special key like Enter or Escape.
>
>For instance, if someone pressed the 'A' key, `keyInfo.Key` would hold the value `ConsoleKey.A`. If it's the Enter key, you'd find `ConsoleKey.Enter`. It's a way to categorize the nature of the pressed key beyond its visual representation.

Special keys (.Key) are those that don't have a direct printable character representation. These include function keys, arrow keys, and keys like Enter or Escape.

Imagine you're building a game, and you want the player to move up when they press the 'Up Arrow' key. The 'Up Arrow' key is a special key because it doesn't represent a character like 'A' or '1'.

```c#
ConsoleKeyInfo keyInfo = Console.ReadKey();
if (keyInfo.Key == ConsoleKey.UpArrow)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Move Up");
}
```

Here, the program checks if the pressed key is the 'Up Arrow' key, triggering the action to move the player upward in the game.
### .KeyChar Property

>[!example] .KeyChar Property
>The `KeyChar` property, on the other hand, specifically deals with the character representation of the pressed key. It comes into play when the key corresponds to a printable character, like letters or numbers. If you pressed the 'A' key, `keyInfo.KeyChar` would be 'A'. However, for non-printable keys like Enter or Escape, `KeyChar` would be a control character, typically represented by an empty space.

 The `keyChar` property in C# is a part of the `ConsoleKeyInfo` structure, and it represents the Unicode character that corresponds to the pressed console key. When you use `Console.ReadKey()`, it returns a `ConsoleKeyInfo` object that contains information about the key that was pressed, including the associated character.
 
 ```c#
  ConsoleKeyInfo keyInfo = Console.ReadKey();
  char pressedChar = keyInfo.KeyChar;
  
  Console.WriteLine($"You pressed the char: {pressedChar}");
 ```

In this example, `keyInfo.KeyChar` is used to extract the character associated with the pressed key, and it's then displayed using `Console.WriteLine`. Keep in mind that `keyChar` might be a visible character (like 'A', '1', or '@'), or it might be a control character (like Enter or Tab) that doesn't have a visible representation.
### .Modifier Property

>[!info] Modifiers!
>Now, let's talk about `Modifiers`. This property holds information about any modifier keys that were pressed simultaneously with the main key. Modifiers include keys like Ctrl, Shift, and Alt. The `Modifiers` property is a bit special; it doesn't give you a single key but provides a combination of them if multiple modifiers are pressed.
>
>For example, if someone pressed 'Ctrl + A', `keyInfo.Modifiers` would include `ConsoleModifiers.Control`. If they pressed 'Ctrl + Shift + A', it would include both `ConsoleModifiers.Control` and `ConsoleModifiers.Shift`.
>
>In essence, these properties provide a nuanced understanding of the key event, allowing you to tailor your application's response based on the specific key, character, and modifiers involved. It's like having a detailed report of the keyboard interaction, empowering you to create more sophisticated and responsive console applications.

Modifiers are keys that, when pressed in combination with other keys, modify the action of the main key. Common modifiers include Ctrl (Control), Shift, and Alt.

Suppose you're designing a text editor, and you want to implement a shortcut to select all text. You might decide that pressing 'Ctrl + A' accomplishes this. Here, 'Ctrl' is a modifier, and it modifies the action of the 'A' key to mean "select all." If you'd pressed only Ctrl the modifier would be 0 because it only works with multiple inputs like Shift + A or Ctrl + P etc.. In this case P and A are keys and CTRL and SHIFT are modifiers.

```c#
ConsoleKeyInfo keyInfo = Console.ReadKey();

if ((keyInfo.Modifiers & ConsoleModifiers.Control) != 0 && keyInfo.Key ==
ConsoleKey.A)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Select All");
}
```

In this example, the program checks if the 'Ctrl' key is pressed (`keyInfo.Modifiers & ConsoleModifiers.Control != 0`) along with the 'A' key, indicating the desire to select all.
### ConsoleKeyInfo Example

Using the gathered knowledge, you can now build the simple program that will loop until the key is pressed.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Press any key. Press Esc to exit.");

while (true)
{
    ConsoleKeyInfo keyInfo = Console.ReadKey();

    if (keyInfo.Key == ConsoleKey.Escape)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Exiting the loop.");
        break;
    }

    Console.WriteLine($"You pressed: {keyInfo.KeyChar}");
}
```

This structure enables continuous interaction until the specified exit key is pressed, adding a layer of dynamism to your application. 

>[!warning] ConsoleKeyInfo Struct
>Because the ConsoleKeyInfo is a struct type, you could use the `var` keyword. But it is not recommended as in some cases it can produce errors. Sometimes it is better to stay specific.

## Difference between .Key and .KeyChar

In C#, when you use `Console.ReadKey()`, it returns a `ConsoleKeyInfo` object that contains information about the key pressed. `keyInfo.Key` is a property of this object, and it represents the enumerated[^1] type `ConsoleKey`. It provides information about the particular key that was pressed, including special keys like function keys, arrow keys, and modifier keys.

>[!info]- What's an `Enum`?
>In programming, an enumeration, often referred to as an enum, is a user-defined data type consisting of named constant values. These constant values represent a set of distinct, named values, and they make the code more readable and maintainable.

In programming, an enumeration, often referred to as an enum, is a user-defined data type consisting of named constant values. These constant values represent a set of distinct, named values, and they make the code more readable and maintainable.

>
>In this example, `DaysOfWeek` is an enumeration that represents the days of the week. The names (Sunday, Monday, etc.) are symbolic constants, and each corresponds to an integer value (starting from 0).

Here's a simple example illustrating the difference between `keyChar` and `Key`:

```csharp
ConsoleKeyInfo keyInfo = Console.ReadKey();

char pressedChar = keyInfo.KeyChar;
ConsoleKey pressedKey = keyInfo.Key;

Console.WriteLine($"You pressed the character: {pressedChar}");
Console.WriteLine($"You pressed the key: {pressedKey}");
```

In this example, `keyInfo.KeyChar` gives you the Unicode character associated with the pressed key, while `keyInfo.Key` gives you information about the specific key pressed, such as Enter, ArrowUp, or F1.

So, `keyChar` deals with the actual character represented by the key, and `Key` deals with the identity of the key itself.
## The ConsoleKey Struct

In C#, `ConsoleKey` is an enumerated type (enum)[^1] that represents keys on a keyboard. It's a part of the `System` namespace. This enum is often used in console applications to identify specific keys when processing input from the console.

Here are some common keys represented by the `ConsoleKey` enum:

- `A`, `B`, ..., `Z`: Alphabetic keys
- `D0`, `D1`, ..., `D9`: Numeric keys (0-9)
- `F1`, `F2`, ..., `F24`: Function keys
- `Enter`: Enter key
- `Escape`: Escape key
- `Spacebar`: Spacebar key
- `Tab`: Tab key
- `Backspace`: Backspace key
- `LeftArrow`, `RightArrow`, `UpArrow`, `DownArrow`: Arrow keys
- `PageUp`, `PageDown`: Page Up and Page Down keys
- `Home`, `End`: Home and End keys
- `Insert`, `Delete`: Insert and Delete keys
- `NumPad0`, `NumPad1`, ..., `NumPad9`: Numeric keypad keys

Here's a simple example of using `ConsoleKey`:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        ConsoleKeyInfo keyInfo = Console.ReadKey();

        // Check if the pressed key is Enter
        if (keyInfo.Key == ConsoleKey.Enter)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You pressed the Enter key!");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"You pressed the key: {keyInfo.Key}");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the program checks if the key pressed is the Enter key using `ConsoleKey.Enter`. The `ConsoleKey` enum provides a convenient way to work with keyboard input in console applications.

>[!tip] ConsoleKey vs ConsoleKeyInfo
>`ConsoleKey` and `ConsoleKeyInfo` are related but represent different aspects of console input in C#.
>
>1. **ConsoleKey Enum:**
>   - `ConsoleKey` is an enum that represents keys on a keyboard.
>   - It provides named constants for various keys like letters, numbers, function keys, and special keys.
  > - It's often used for comparing or switching based on the pressed key in a console application.
>
 >  Example:
>
>   ```csharp
>   ConsoleKey key = ConsoleKey.Enter;
 >  if (key == ConsoleKey.Enter)
 >  {
>       // Do something for Enter key
 >  }
>   ```
>
>2. **ConsoleKeyInfo Struct:**
 >  - `ConsoleKeyInfo` is a struct that represents the character and key that a console keypress event represents.
 >  - It includes properties like `KeyChar` (representing the Unicode character), `Key` (representing the `ConsoleKey`), and `Modifiers` (representing modifier keys like Ctrl, Shift, Alt).
 >  - It's commonly used when you need information about both the key and the associated character when processing console input.
>
>   Example:
>
>   ```csharp
   ConsoleKeyInfo keyInfo = Console.ReadKey();
   char keyChar = keyInfo.KeyChar;
   ConsoleKey key = keyInfo.Key;
   ConsoleModifiers modifiers = keyInfo.Modifiers;
>   ```
>
>In summary, `ConsoleKey` is an enum representing specific keys on the keyboard, while `ConsoleKeyInfo` is a struct representing the details of a keypress event, including the key, associated character, and modifiers. They work together to provide comprehensive information about user input in console applications.
## **KeyAvailable Property**

When you're building a console program, you might want it to stay active and responsive to user input without pausing everything. That's where `ReadKey` and `KeyAvailable` come in handy. KeyAvailable is like a little spy that checks if a key is ready to be pressed without causing your program to wait around doing nothing

```csharp
if (Console.KeyAvailable)
{
    ConsoleKeyInfo keyInfo = Console.ReadKey();
    Console.WriteLine($"You pressed: {keyInfo.KeyChar}");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("No key is currently available.");
}
```

This piece of code says: "Hey, if there's a key ready to go, grab it with `ReadKey` and let me know what it is. If not, just tell me that no key is around."

# Difference between Read and ReadKey

Related Note: [[Read Method]].

In C#, `Console.Read()` and `Console.ReadKey()` are both methods used for reading input from the console, but they have some key differences:

1. **Return Type:**
   - `Console.Read()`: Returns an integer representing the Unicode value of the character read.
   - `Console.ReadKey()`: Returns a `ConsoleKeyInfo` structure, which contains information about the key pressed, including the character and any modifier keys.

2. **Usage:**
   - `Console.Read()`: Reads the next character from the standard input stream (console) and advances the cursor.
   - `Console.ReadKey()`: Waits for a key press and returns information about the pressed key. It does not require the Enter key to be pressed.

3. **Buffer Handling:**
   - `Console.Read()`: Reads a single character from the input buffer, or blocks until a character is available. It reads characters as soon as they are entered without waiting for the Enter key.
   - `Console.ReadKey()`: Waits for a key press and does not require the Enter key to be pressed. It provides more immediate feedback and captures additional information like modifier keys.

4. **Example:**
   - `Console.Read()` Example:

     ```csharp
     int unicodeValue = Console.Read();
     Console.WriteLine($"You entered: {unicodeValue}");
     ```

   - `Console.ReadKey()` Example:

     ```csharp
     ConsoleKeyInfo keyInfo = Console.ReadKey();
     Console.WriteLine($"You pressed: {keyInfo.KeyChar}");
     ```

In summary, `Console.Read()` is used for reading individual characters from the console, returning their Unicode values, while `Console.ReadKey()` is used for capturing keypress events, providing richer information about the pressed key and not requiring the Enter key to be pressed.
