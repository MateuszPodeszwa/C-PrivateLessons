# The C# Programming Language

- C# is a general purpose programming language. You can do almost anything in it!
-  C# runs on **.NET**, which is many things: a _runtime_ that supports your program, a _library_ of   code to build upon, and a set of tools to aid in constructing.

Computers are amazing machines capable of executing billions of tasks in the matter of seconds. The people who harness these powerful machines to solve meaningful problems are the wizards of the computing world we call programmers.

Humans and computers do not speak the same language, human language is imprecise and open to interpretation. The binary instructions computers use, formed from 1's and 0's, are precise but very difficult for humans to use. Programming languages bridge the two-precise enough for a computer to run but clear to humans to understand.
# What is C#?

There are many programming languages out there, but **C#** is one of the few that is both widely used and very loved. C# is build upon a **.NET** platform, which is often called a framework, but .NET is an entire ecosystem surrounding C#. This ecosystem contains all bunch of tools, classes and functions that will improve your programming experience.
## Key features:

- C# is general-purpose programming language. Some languages solve only a specific type  of problem. C# is designed to solve virtually any problem equally well. You can use it to create games, websites, desktop and mobile applications!<br>
- C# strikes a balance between power and ease of use. Some languages give the programmer more control than C#, but with more ways to go wrong. Other languages do more to ensure bad things can't happen by removing some of this control. C# tries to give you both power and ease of use.<br>
- C# is a cross-platform language, meaning that can be used either on mobile devices, macs or windows computers.
