# Defining a Method

To make a new method, we need to understand where and how to make a method. The following code illustrates one way to do it:

```c#
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");

void CountToTen()
{
	for (int current = 1; current <= 10; current++)
		Console.WriteLine(current);
}
```

The line that says `void CountToTen()`, the curly braces, and everything inside them defines a new `CountToTen` method.

For the moment, let's focus on that `void CountToTen()` line. This line **declares** or creates a method and establishes how to use it. **CountToTen** is the method's name. Like variables, you have a lot of flexibility on naming your methods, but most C# programmers will use **UpperCamelCase** for all methods names.

The `void` part, before the name, is the method's *return type*. Which means that the **void** methods will not return any values, or differently: the method does not produce a result.

Every method declaration includes a set of parentheses containing information for the method to use. **CountToTen** doesn't need any information to do its job, so we've left the parentheses empty for now. For example, the method do not take any value to count to ten, it just does its job.

After the declaration is the method's body, containing all the code that should run when called. In this case, the body is the curly braces and all statements in between. You can include any C# code inside methods.

## Local Functions

Our definition of `CountToTen` above puts it inside of the main method. The code map below illustrates this arrangement:

1. Console Application
	1. Program
		1. Main (the starting point method)
			1. CountToTen - the method
				1. For loop
					1. current - the variable

---

Until now, we have only seen methods that live directly in a class. For example [[WriteLine Method]] lives in **Console**, and **Main** lives in **Program**. This map shows that methods can also be defined inside other methods. 

>[!warning] Difference between **Method** and **Function** / **Local Function**
>Formally, any reusable, callable code block is a **function**, a function is also a method if it is a member of a class. So technically, **Main** is a method, but **CountToTen** is not. Functions that are defined inside of other functions are known as *local functions*. So **CountToTen** is a local function, but **Main** is not. 

A local function can live anywhere within its containing method. You could put them at the top, above your other statements, at the bottom, after your statements, or somewhere in the middle - the compiler **don't care** where they go. The compiler extracts them and gives them slightly different names behind the scenes, so it doesn't care about the ordering. Since they can go anywhere, use it as your advantage.

# Calling a Method

Our code above defined a **CountToTen** method but didn't put it to use. Let's fix that. We've called methods before, like `Console.WriteLine`, so the syntax should be familiar.

```c#
CountToTen();

void CountToTen() 
{
	for (int current = 1; current <= 10; current++)
		Console.WriteLine(current);
}
```

The most notable difference is that we didn't put a class name first, as we have done with `Console.WriteLine()`. Since **CountToTen** lives in our main method, we can refer to it without any qualifiers from anywhere in the main method.

The code runs by reading the `CountToTen()` and then the compiler remembers when it occurred, then it goes inside the referred method, and executes the code inside it. After the compiler execute the method's code, the flow of execution flows back where it encounter the method. Just like:

1. Execute the code above `CountToTen()`.
2. Meet the `CountToTen()` method and goes inside of it.
3. Execute any code found inside of `CountToTen()` method.
4. Back to the original code, start from the place you stopped.

Notably, just because the definition of **CountToTen** lives at the end of the method does not mean it will get called then. Only an actual method call will cause the method to run. A definition alone is not sufficient for that. We can, of course, call our new method more than once. Reusing code is a key reason for methods in the first place:

```c#
CountToTen();
( ... ) // Some Code
CountToTen();
```
